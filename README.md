MOD12003 bodge board
====================

During testing, the linear driver on the MOD12003 was shown not to be robust
enough; it lost bias during an abusive "file" test (rapidly shorting/opening
the output by rubbing a wire over a file). This is an updated driver circuit
to be patched into Rev A of MOD12003.
